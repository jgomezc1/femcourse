    "\n",

    "* Loads data: Load vector (defined in a cartesian reference system) and nodal data for each loaded loaded point in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Materials data: Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for each new material appearing in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of a model in **SolidsPy** involves two basic steps, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (i) meshing the 2D domain\n",
    "\n",
    "* (ii) writing the input (text) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of complex domains resulting in a large number of elements step 1 is conducted with third party software. Here we will use [gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) to create finite element meshes. On the other hand, step 2 involving the process of writing the input files for **SolidsPy** is performed using subroutines available in the Python module [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio). The complete process is schematically described in the figure below."
